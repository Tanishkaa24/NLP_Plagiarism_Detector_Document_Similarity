I always look forward to spending every day in my school. I am happy about going to my school, meeting friends, interacting with teachers, and learning new things. Being in school is like being in a place where friends and family always surround me. Moreover, it is like a family that provides me with education and other necessary skills.My school is like a home away from home, where I don’t feel out of place or homesick. It is a place where I learn, laugh, smile, play, and enjoy. It stirred up many emotions in me for good reasons, and I will always be thankful to my school and wonderful teachers.
