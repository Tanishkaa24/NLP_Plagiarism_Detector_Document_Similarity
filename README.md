# NLP_Plagiarism_Detector_Document_Similarity

This project focuses on implementing various techniques for plagiarism detection and document similarity using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods such as cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Euclidean distance.

Overview
The primary objective of this project is to explore and demonstrate different NLP-based approaches to identify similarities between documents and detect potential instances of plagiarism. By employing well-known similarity measures like cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Euclidean distance, this repository showcases how these methods can be utilized to compare textual content and quantify their similarity.

Features
Cosine Similarity: Utilizes the cosine of the angle between two document vectors to measure their similarity.
Jaccard Similarity: Computes similarity by comparing the intersection and union of sets of words between documents.
Euclidean Distance: Measures the distance between document vectors to assess their dissimilarity.

The application of plagiarism detection and document similarity techniques using NLP has broad implications across diverse domains, contributing to maintaining integrity, originality, and security in various fields while enhancing data analysis and information retrieval processes.
