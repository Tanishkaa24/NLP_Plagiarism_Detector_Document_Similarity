Academic integrity is a cornerstone of the educational system, and plagiarism is a grave transgression that can lead to significant repercussions for students. It is imperative that students have a clear grasp of what constitutes plagiarism and the means to circumvent it. Plagiarism arises when an individual appropriates another person's concepts, language, or creations without duly acknowledging their source. To sidestep plagiarism, it is paramount to consistently attribute the original work through appropriate citations and references. Upholding academic integrity is not just a requirement; it is a fundamental principle, and students must endeavor to create authentic content to preserve their own academic standing.
